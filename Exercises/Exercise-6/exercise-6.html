        <p>This project was for my Design Practice class in which we were to contact a non-profit organization and create different designs for<br>them. The client that I decided to go with is Red Creek Wildlife Center in Schuylkill Haven, PA. One of the designs that I was asked<br>to create was a brochure, pictured above, highlighting what they do as well as their mission.</p>
