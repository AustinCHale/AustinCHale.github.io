<h1>Explore Exciting Poker Variants</h1>

<p>While Texas Hold'em is the most popular poker variant, the world of poker offers a diverse range of games.<br>Here are a few intriguing variants to consider:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Omaha Hold'em: Similar to Texas Hold'em, but players receive four hole cards, and they must use<br>exactly two of them to form their hand.</li>
<li>Seven Card Stud: Players receive seven cards, and the goal is to form the best five-card hand. Betting<br>rounds follow each card dealt.</li>
<li>Five Card Draw: Each player is dealt five private cards, and they can exchange some or all of them<br>for new cards in an attempt to improve their hand.</li>
<li>Razz: A lowball variant where the goal is to have the lowest possible hand. Straights and flushes<br>don't count, and Aces are low.</li>
<li>Pineapple and Crazy Pineapple: Variants of Hold'em where players receive three hole cards, but in<br>Crazy Pineapple, one card must be discarded after the flop.</li>
<li>Stud High-Low: A split-pot variant of Seven Card Stud where the highest and lowest hands share<br>the winnings.</li>
</ol>

<p>Poker is a game of skill, strategy, and psychology that offers endless excitement and opportunities for<br>improvement. Whether you choose to start with Texas Hold'em or explore other variants, poker is a<br>game that rewards dedication and practice. Join the poker community, sharpen your skills, and enjoy<br>the thrill of the cards!</p>
